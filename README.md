This is the implementation of the paper "Actor-Critic Physics-informed Neural Lyapunov Control". All hard-coded floating point values in plotting_new.ipynb can be found from one of the following:

- lqr2.ipynb (e.g the K matrix)
- the paper "Neural Lyapunov Control"
- Linearizing the dynamical system at x=0

We also uploaded the PyTorch checkpoints, but you need to fix the path in plotting_new.ipynb to make the plotting work.
