This is the implementation of the paper "Actor-Critic Neural Zubov Control". All floating point values in plotting_new.ipynb can be found either from lqr2.ipynb (e.g the K matrix) or from the 
paper "Neural Lyapunov Control".

We also uploaded the PyTorch checkpoints, but you need to fix the path in plotting_new.ipynb to make the plotting work.
